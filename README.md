# Bayesian_Modeling_Covid19
A Bayesian approach of the modeling COVID19 spread based on the Gompertz equation. It uses
* the R Interface to COVID-19 Data Hub (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/COVID19/index.html) of Guidotti and Ardia (COVID-19 Data Hub.‚Äù Journal of Open Source Software, 5(51), 2376. doi: 10.21105/joss.02376.) to retrive current COVID19 data worldwide. 
* RJAGS package of Martyn Plummer to perform MCMC to obtain posterior estimates (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/index.html).
